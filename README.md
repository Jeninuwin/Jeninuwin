👋🏽 Hi, my name is Jenny Nguyen!

🎓 Soon to be grad with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with minors in Software Engineering and Graphic Design. (May 2022)

🌴 Currently residing in South Dakota, where the weather is always changing every 5 minutes, but Cali is my true home.

📚 In the past I have worked with South Dakota State University as a Community/Resident Assistant by facilitating the social, academic, and personal adjustment of all students to the residence hall while enforcing and upholding policies of Housing and Residence Life and the University. Currently, I am working as an IT/Programming Student for the University. As an IT Student, I resolve issues for users by advising possible solutions along with using various resources to meet their needs. While working as a Programming Student, I have optimized various Web Tools, such as utilizing partial JavaScript paired with CSS, HTML, and SharePoint to create user-friendly user interfaces. I have also created Icons/Graphics and Email templates in Illustrator, HTML, CSS, and Photoshop for various University websites to represent what they are used for.

💻 As for my future, I hope to one day work in a role that combines my technical and people skills, such as a Product Manager, Front-end Developer, or UX Designer on a diverse team that has a passion to help change the world, one step at a time.

🌿 In my free time, I love to knit, bake, watch anime, and garden; you can always ask me what plants I'm currently propagating or what recipes I'm cooking up!

💪🏽 Passionate, empathic, collaborative leader, excellent communicator, hard-working, and open-minded.
